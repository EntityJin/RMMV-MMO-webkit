# RMMV-MMO-webkit
MMORPG webkit for RPG Maker MV using NodeJS &amp; Socket.io

# Project status : On Hold. *(Edit: 26/12/16)*
This project haven't really been dropped, but just put aside for a few moment, because there's a lot of things to rethink in order to allow a true and smooth multiplayer support!
One of the biggest challenge in this project is to build from scratch a brand-new online and in-browser game editor using maybe React or Angular technologies. Another challenge is to properly set up an optimised server/client communication protocol, and I need a bit more experience in this.

This kind of remodeling involve to put a lot of time in it, and at the moment I'm lacking of time du to my challenging full-time job.
Anyway, I eventually plan to come back working on it soon, but there's many point I need to clarify before that.

Stay tuned :)
